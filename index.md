## Welcome to My Project Page

I chose this text-based format for my game for two reasons:
* To focus on the **decisions** the player will make.
* Text-based games are a very "primitive" form of computer games that many players may not be familiar with, which adds an elemtent of **exoticism**.

### Can you reach the beyond? Or are you at the mercy of fate?
